<h2>ðŸ“¶ Making Buildings Wireless Friendly</h2>
<p>The task of this project was to create a website which explained how wireless signals worked and to introduce a technology called FSS (Frequency Selective Surfaces).</p>
<p>The main feature is a HTML5 canvas element which interactively shows how wireless access points behave in a variety of situations by showing green (good) and red (bad) signal areas. The applet has 6 scenarios; each one introducing more wireless access points, walls, changing the access points' channel/transmit power and also the ability to change the walls' resistance.</p>
