<h2>ðŸ“¶ Making Buildings Wireless Friendly</h2>

<p>This project involved creating a website that explains how wireless signals work and introduces <strong>FSS (Frequency Selective Surfaces)</strong>â€”a technology that helps manage signal interference in wireless communication.</p>

<p>The main feature is an <strong>HTML5 canvas</strong> that shows how wireless access points behave in different situations. The interactive applet visualises the signal quality with green (good) and red (bad) areas. There are 6 scenarios, each introducing new elements like additional access points, walls, and changes to the access points' channel/transmit power. Users can also adjust the resistance of the walls.</p>
