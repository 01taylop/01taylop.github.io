<p>Using the best practiced web standards and latest technologies, I create beautiful, professional websites and mobile apps with intuitive and rich user experiences.</p>
<p>My current goal is to contribute more to the open-source community.</p>
<p>I have a BSc (Multimedia Technology and Design) and an MSc (Mobile Application Design) degrees; both from the University of Kent.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, I drink a lot of coffee, but I am learning Portuguese and enjoy playing altinha.</p>
