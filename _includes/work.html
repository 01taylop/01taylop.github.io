<p>I love travel, exploration, and technology—and I bring those passions together by working on exciting projects at Expedia.</p>

<p>There, I focus on building and maintaining a micro-frontend architecture that serves as a foundation for multiple teams to contribute modules, ensuring scalability, reusability, and seamless integration across the platform.</p>
