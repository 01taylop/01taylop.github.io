<p>My name is Patrick Taylor, a London-based software engineer with a passion for creative, clean and intuitive user-experiences.</p>
<p>Although I am passionate about React and all things frontend, I enjoy working full-stack with a focus to create reusable, performant and accessible applications.</p>
